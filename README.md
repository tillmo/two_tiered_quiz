# Two-tiered multiple choice quiz
A multiple choice quiz with a second tier. After selecting an answer to a multiple choice question, one has to choose from several justifications of this answer. This will impede a random filling out, and foster a deeper understanding. Moreover, for a wrong justification, the user can get an explanation why it is wrong.
